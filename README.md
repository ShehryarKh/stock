building a terminal stock trader game.
Our game is going to give users a starting amount of money - maybe $100,000? and let them buy and sell stocks based on the current market info we get from the Markit API. 
* It should update their earnings whenever they login. There should be an admin who can log in and get an up to date leaderboard.
* 
Install the `requests` library using `pip3`
	* [HTTP request library](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
* We'll be using the [Markit on Demand API](http://dev.markitondemand.com/) 
* We will be pulling data from this API in JSON format
